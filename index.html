  <h2>Problem 1</h2>
    <p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

  <h3>The sum of the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: <span id="odd_multiples"></span></h3>
  <br><br>

  <h2>Problem 2</h2>
  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
  By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br>
  <p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
  find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p><br>
  <h3>The sum of the even-valued terms is: <span id="even_fib"></span></h3>
